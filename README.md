# Point cloud streaming WebRTC SFU

This repository contains the open source WebRTC SFU and reference client implementation that can be used to streaming point clouds (as well as other types of content).

Both the SFU and reference client implementation can be found at: [webrtc](webrtc). If you want to integrate this specific client implementation in another application (such as Unity) you will also have to use the [connector application](connected).
